# CanonicalEquivalence: A Syntactic Construction of Canonical Kripke Models

This Agda formalization demonstrates a constructive correspondence between derivability in a minimal intuitionistic propositional logic and canonical Kripke models. It includes a full syntactic proof of compactness and finitary derivability, and will ultimately construct a canonical Kripke model from syntactic data, establishing a form of soundness and completeness entirely within a syntactic setting.

The goal of this project is to show that canonical Kripke semantics *recapitulate syntactic structure*, and to make precise the sense in which model-theoretic notions in intuitionistic logic can be grounded constructively.

## âœ¨ Highlights

* **Formal system**: A minimal IPL with `âŠ¥`, `â†’`, `âˆ§`, and `âˆ¨`
* **Proof system**: Inductive derivability judgment `Î“ âŠ¦ Ï•`
* **Compactness**: If `Î“ âŠ¦ âŠ¥`, then some finite `Î” âŠ† Î“` has `Î” âŠ¦ âŠ¥`
* **Constructive completeness**: `âˆ€Î”. Î” âŠ† Î“ â†’ Î” âŠ¦ Ï•` implies `Î“ âŠ¦ Ï•`
* **Contrapositive**: If `Â¬- **Contrapositive**: If `\xac(Î“ âŠ¦ Ï•)`, then âˆƒ finite `Î” âŠ† Î“`such that`Â¬`such that`\xac(Î” âŠ¦ Ï•)\`
* **Kripke models (in progress)**: Canonical construction of a Kripke frame from syntactic entailment and demonstration that forcing aligns with `âŠ¦`

The project aims to show that even Kripke semanticsâ€”typically viewed as a model-theoretic or semantic toolâ€”can be reconstructed from syntactic, constructive data alone.
